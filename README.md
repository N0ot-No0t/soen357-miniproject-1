# CapChat
Healthy Screen Super App



## Introduction

In modern society, people have spent hours upon hours on their smart phone devices, performing as many tasks as that of a computer. The applications range from phone and messaging to entertainment. 



## The problem

Spending hours on the screen may ultimately negatively affect the health and well being of users. 



## The solution 
With current super apps like WeChat and GoJek, all major apps are tracked and by including screen time features, users will benefit from healthy screen usage. Our super app will include
Messaging, private posts, transportation (Uber), banking and subscription to businesses. To improve the wellbeing of our users, we included features such as time spent on app, how much time the user wants to spend away from their device, setting a limit on how much time the user wants to spend on social media and block apps that distract you from being productive.

## User personas

The user personas are based on the survey responses that we received. Based on the types of apps used in our superapp, every user persona is either a user of an app (banking, social media) or other apps (games).

## User journey

A user journey can represent the usual actions a user performs on an application, as well as the thoughts and emotions behind that process. We decided to create James Smith's potential journey, which displays the actions he takes to develop healthier life and screen habits. Even though James reaches his set daily screen time limit, he feels satisfied because he is working towards reducing his frustration that _stemmed_ from social media being too time consuming.

## Sketches and wireframes

Once we identified common needs of potential clients, we identified features that we wished to implement. The main features of the application are messaging, banking, screen time limiting, transportation, calories tracking and workout planning. After having identified these features, we started the sketching phase. These sketches were very useful for creating the wireframes and the design of the app.

</p>

After creating the sketches, we were able deisgn wireframes without much hassle. Our goal was to create an application that is intuitive for the user to use, while also keeping the design modern and offer all functionalities identified earlier. We decided to also display the user flow inside the wireframes.

## Color palette

For the color scheme, we decided it was necessary to remain on the topic of healthy habits and opt for a shade of green as a primary color. During our initial research, we looked at apps like WeChat and also Whatsapp for their implementation of the messaging feature, both of which use shades of green successfully. Our main goal was to provide the user with a pleasing and smooth deisgn, but also subtly encourage them to develop and maintain healthier habits. However, for the workout feature we decided that a hotter and more aggressive color should be used. Users would likely use this feature at the gym or during a workout, which means an energetic orange would be more motivating than a pleasant green.

## Name and logo

Consummers often get their first impression of a product from its name and its logo. Thus, it was important for us to give our application a catchy name and an interesting logo while also conveying the message behind it. For the name we went with _CapChat_, which is a play on captcha that also includes our two main features: screen time cap and chatting. For our logo, we focused on the idea of a _super_ app and our healthy lifestyle features and came up with the idea to have a superhero vegetable be the face of the application. Super Broccoli.

## Typography

We decided on three using fonts for CapChat: Lato, Roboto and Nunito. The former one, Lato, will be the main font of the application. Lato is calm and pleasant, which is prefect for most of our features. We chose to use Roboto for the navigation and the banking feature, because it is more formal and adds contrast to the design. For the workout feature, using a gentle font would feel awkward. Instead, we decided to use Roboto, which is a bit harsher than Lato and less formal than Roboto.

## Conclusion

To conclude, healthy screen time was achieved through the use of this superapp. Users fitting in one of the three personas, will benefit from the appâ€™s features and have a positive experience with their device. From the sketches, it can be seen that there are a number of features (screen limit) that focus on maintaining healthy screen usage and other features like ride-sharing, calorie tracking and workouts that provide functionality for the user.
