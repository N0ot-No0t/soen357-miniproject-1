Healthy Screen Super App



## Introduction

In modern society, people have spent hours upon hours on their smart phone devices, performing as many tasks as that of a computer. The applications range from phone and messaging to entertainment. 



## The problem

Spending hours on the screen may ultimately negatively affect the health and well being of users. 



## The solution 
With current super apps like WeChat and GoJek, all major apps are tracked and by including screen time features, users will benefit from healthy screen usage. Our super app will include
Messaging, private posts, transportation (Uber), banking and subscription to businesses. To improve the wellbeing of our users, we included features such as time spent on app, how much time the user wants to spend away from their device, setting a limit on how much time the user wants to spend on social media and block apps that distract you from being productive.

## User personas

The user personas are based on the survey responses that we received. Based on the types of apps used in our superapp, every user persona is either a user of an app (banking, social media) or other apps (games).

## User journey

A user journey can represent the usual actions a user performs on an application, as well as the thoughts and emotions behind that process. We decided to create James Smith's potential journey, which displays the actions he takes to develop healthier life and screen habits. Even though James reaches his set daily screen time limit, he feels satisfied because he is working towards reducing his frustration that _stemmed_ from social media being too time consuming.

## Sketches and wireframes

Once we identified common needs of potential clients, we identified features that we wished to implement. The main features of the application are messaging, banking, screen time limiting, transportation, calories tracking and workout planning. After having identified these features, we started the sketching phase. These sketches were very useful for creating the wireframes and the design of the app.
