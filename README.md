Healthy Screen Super App

Introduction
In modern society, people have spent hours upon hours on their smart phone devices, performing as many tasks as that of a computer. The applications range from phone and messaging to entertainment. 

The problem
Spending hours on the screen may ultimately negatively affect the health and well being of users. 

The solution 
With current super apps like WeChat and GoJek, all major apps are tracked and by including screen time features, users will benefit from healthy screen usage. Our super app will include
Messaging, private posts, transportation (Uber), banking and subscription to businesses. To improve the wellbeing of our users, we included features such as time spent on app, how much time the user wants to spend away from their device, setting a limit on how much time the user wants to spend on social media and block apps that distract you from being productive.
